I am Shraddha shriraj khade, a cybersecurity enthusiast driven by a passion for understanding emerging threats and developing practical tools to address them. My primary interest lies in analyzing how modern cyber attacks operate — particularly in the context of AI systems — and crafting solutions that enhance their security.

As part of this commitment, I developed a project titled Prompt Injection Attack on AI System. The project focuses on identifying and demonstrating vulnerabilities in AI models that can be exploited through maliciously crafted inputs, known as prompt injections. These attacks manipulate the behavior of language models by embedding deceptive instructions within seemingly benign user inputs, potentially leading to unintended or harmful outputs.

To explore this, I created a basic tool that simulates such attacks and helps detect patterns that might indicate a prompt injection attempt. It analyzes prompt structure, flags abnormal input sequences, and evaluates how these inputs influence model behavior. The goal is to build awareness around this emerging threat and to lay the groundwork for defenses against AI-specific attack vectors.

While still in its early stages, this project highlights the importance of securing AI systems and contributes to the broader effort of building safer, more resilient technologies. It reflects my hands-on approach to learning and my dedication to solving contemporary cybersecurity challenges.
